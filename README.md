# Decentralized Exam Evaluation And Certification Issue System

This is a DApp,

1. Automatically evaluate the answers,
2. Get results and issue the certification

## Stacks
- Truffle
- - web3
- Ethereum Blockchain
- Vue
- - vue-router
- - bulma

## How to
- open `ganache`
- `truffle compile`
- `truffle migrate` // default to run on local test network
- use `yarn serve` to run the dapp (metamask required)


I use a truffle box, [Yet-Another-Truffle-Vue-Box](https://github.com/tim-hub/Yet-Another-Truffle-Vue-Box) which is altered by myself and based on vue-box to develop this DApp.

Bulma is used in vue front-end project for the layour and style.

## Ideas
- one way to avoid users keep taking exam again and again to get higher score is to increase the fee automatically, like * 2, or ^ 2.
- add a print button in certification page.
